##Franchise Fees and Operating Costs##

Our exact operating costs, and thus our franchise fee structure, is unknown at this moment. 

Our goal is to have a affordable cost for yearly certification and franchise membership. 

Our operating expenses will be available, in detail, to any franchise members. The summary of our operating costs will be made public. 

Our goal is to estimate at the beginning of every month how much our costs will be and then to charge franchise partners enough money to meet those requirements, plus 20% for growth, and 20% for unexpected needs. Any overage above the 100% of operating costs and 20% profit margin meant to expand on the business will be placed into a fund where the franchise partners can vote to dispurse as they see fit. 

Possible options are 
* Add the funds to the marketing budget
* Add the funds to a franchise startup fund, to lower the initial startup cost
* Return the funds to the franchise partners as dividend
* Use the funds to further development of independant developers who work on BlockAuth specific projects
* Use the funds to further development to fund non-BlockAuth specific projects
* Roll the funds back into BlockAuth to help the organization itself grow, add more staff, and add more features
* Other special projects

Existing expenses are always available for discussion and auditing so legacy costs won't burdon the project. If franchise partners identity a way to lower our hosting costs, it'll be considered and put up for a vote. 

The eventual goal is to allow this organization to be entirely democratically run where all of the stakeholders, financial and otherwise, have a role in determining the future and direction.
