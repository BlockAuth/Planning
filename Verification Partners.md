##You can participate in the BlockAuth ecosystem without offering login services


Some BlockAuth approved identity verification providers won’t be able to do the same verifications that the others can do. That’s where the marketplace goes into effect. 

All verification systems have to be audited by BlockAuth to make sure they are valid. When they are certified, they are listed in the directory and the owner can choose to allow other BlockAuth providers to access the API’s for a listed fee. 

This will allow a provider to specialize in certain types of verifications.
