##Different industries and how they can be affected

##Adult Services
The online adult entertainment industry has a few problems that have never been thoroughly addressed. 

First of all, some material is not legal in all jurisdictions due to the content, age of the viewer, or outright bans on adult material. Only allowing BlockAuth validated users, adult sites can ensure that their clientele is meeting all of the sites legal requirements. 

Payment systems integrated with the users identity provider also provide an opportunity for users and the industry to embrace micropayment models rather than old-fashioned monthly membership business models. It also gives an opportunity for smaller studios or individual actors to handle payment processing without risk of chargeback or the difficulties found when trying to get a payment processor for an adult service. It also opens their business up to worldwide audiences. 

Lastly, new industry movements are causing sites to commission work from independant actors, which comes with onerous record-keeping requirements (see 18 U.S. Code ยง 2257, section b at http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2257 )

Requiring all independent actors to have verified BlockAuth accounts will allow those actors to maintain their privacy with the website commissioning their work while still meeting the legal requirements set forth in 18 U.S. Code ยง 2257

##Advertising
The advertising industry has had a large number of scandals regarding online ad impressions. Specifically, research indicates that 1/3rd of all online advertising interaction is performed by bots. (see http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304026304579453253860786362 )

While BlockAuth can't protect regular ads on sites from bots, what it can do is give websites the opportunity to show more valuable ad units to users who are logged in and who are verified as being real individuals. 

##Bitcoin Exchanges
Bitcoin exchanges that operate in the United States face strict and rapidly changing regulations regarding money laundering and the requirement that business have the identity of their customer verified. BlockAuth itself solves the Know Your Customer requirements. 

Identity Registrars that choose to offer the integrated cryptocurrency wallet options with micropayments can offer Anti Money Laundering verification services to bitcoin exchanges by being the path that money flows through. 

When a user initiates a withdrawal, if it is hardcoded to go to their Identity Registrar wallet, the identity registrar can perform the required algorithmic checks to determine if there is any suspicious activity.

This also gives users and exchanges a level of privacy and anonymity since the transactions are aggregated into bulk transactions. 

##Blog Comments
Akismet states that their spam filtering service has filtered 148 BILLION spam messages from blogs that use their plugins. Rather than try to keep on fighting the spammers with ever-evolving techniques to defeat spam-detecting algorithms, blogs can simply choose to require commenters have a verified BlockAuth Identity Registrar account. 

Blogs also have the benefit of being able to know that if they ban a user from commenting, they can't just come back from a different IP address or with a different username. 

#Dating Services
Research in 2013 indicates that at least 10% of all profiles on dating sites are fake profiles. In fact, according to the FBI, over 50 million dollars every year is stolen in romance scams related to online dating fraud. 

An existing or up-and-coming dating website that requires user verification using an Identity Registrar would be able to boast that all of their users are real. 

Additional planned optional verification procedures might also benefit the industry as Verification Partners might be able to offer educational achievement verification or employment verification services. The results of those verifications could be certified on a dating site so other users know the truth when someone says they went to Harvard. 

#Demographic Restrictions
Some sites might want to restrict their membership to certain demographics for various reasons. A forum about teens coping with depression might want to restrict user accounts to people under the age of 20. Other restrictions are possible too, such as limiting access to people of a certain gender or educational achievement, or accredited investors. 

#Domain Registration
Several domain registrars offer add-on or built-in WHOIS privacy features. BlockAuth Identity Providers can also provide that feature, while also providing a level of account access security rarely seen in the industry. 

#Investment Services
A Verification Partner can specialize in verifying financial credentials or determine if a user is an accredited investor. This opens up the possibility for various investment sites that want to restrict themselves to wealthy individuals for legal reasons. It also allows for forums or a social network that only lets in SEC certified stock traders, for example. 

#Marketing Surveys
A website could make deals with market research companies in order to give surveys with a greater degree of accuracy. When the user logs in, the OAUTH permissions dialog can ask for permission on all the relevant demographics data (age, gender, marital status, zip code, educational achievement, etc). Then the user can fill out the survey and the person who commissioned the survey can have more assurances that the data is clean. 

#Microloans
There have been experiments with online microloan services, but they've suffered from high default rates due to con artists, fake accounts, and people simply walking away. Doing user verification is hard and BlockAuth Identity Registrars can allow verification tasks to be outsourced to a professional. 

#Micropayments
Every user will have integrated cryptocurrency wallets (different Identity Registrars might offer different currencies). 

The Identity Registrars can bundle micropayments to a site into one single transaction to prevent payment fees from eating up smaller transactions. The reverse is true as well for sites that send micropayments to users. They can send routine  transactions that'll be split up into the smaller amounts distributed to the relevant users. 

A strong attempt will be made to make the micropayment system compatible with the Paypal Mass Pay and Standard Transaction IPN specifications to make it easier for sites to integrate. 

#Online Communities
Online discussion communities can benefit from outsourcing their login infrastructure and user verification to Identity Registrars. It will keep out spam, allow the communities to restrict access to certain demographics, and it'll also guarantee success when they ban a user. 

#Online Gambling
Online Gambling is a difficult industry when it comes to regulations since lots of different jurisdictions have very specific restrictions on the legality or restrictions on who is allowed to gamble. A gambling or betting website that uses a BlockAuth Identity Registrar will benefit from the research that all the sites do together to make their sites legally compliant. 

In addition, integrated cryptocurrency wallets and micropayment systems reduce the friction of funds transfers and allow users to keep track of their expenses and earnings for tax purposes. 

#Online Work
Many websites offer small "work at home" tasks, like Amazon's Mechanical Turk, Fiverr, or ClickWorker. By using an Identity Registrar, sites can be assured that the people performing the work aren't using bots to cheat the system and that they are legally allowed to perform the tasks requested of them. 

In addition, integrated cryptocurrency wallets and micropayment systems reduce the friction of funds transfers and allow users to keep track of their expenses and earnings for tax purposes. 

#Polls and Voting
Requiring users to log in with a verified account from an Identity Registrar will enable online voting and pools to avoid fraudulent voting activity

#Region Locking
Stop trying to restrict access to a service (such as a streaming music or video service) based on IP addresses. A VPN or proxy easily defeats these systems, but verifying the user's location through an Identity Registrar allows services to meet their contractual requirements with content providers.
