By contributing to existing open source projects, we help the community and ourselves. It's both the smart and the right thing to do.

##Operational Overviews
[Ensuring User Privacy Rights](https://github.com/BlockAuth/Planning/blob/master/Ensuring%20User%20Privacy%20Rights.md)
This document describes the user experience when they sign up at a new site and how they can see what information is being requested and how they have the power to deny it or to provide "proxy" information.

[Security Practices](https://github.com/BlockAuth/Planning/blob/master/Security%20Practices.md)
This document describes some of the basic security principals that BlockAuth and all identity registrars must follow, as well as the power users have over the tradeoff between security and convienence. 

[Token Plans and Pricing](https://github.com/BlockAuth/Planning/blob/master/Token%20Plans%20and%20Pricing.md)
The use of the BlockAuth token is integral in the Verification Marketplace feature. This describes what the tokens are, what they're used for, and how much they cost during the crowdsale. It also describes the intended use of the remaining tokens. 

[User Data To Verify](https://github.com/BlockAuth/Planning/blob/master/User%20Data%20To%20Verify.md)
This document is more of a list of information we plan to let users assert that we intend to verify. This list will change often as more and more requests are received

[user Verification Procedures](https://github.com/BlockAuth/Planning/blob/master/User%20Verification%20Procedures.md)
Users may assert information about themselves, but it's the job of the Verification Partner or Identity Registrar to verify that information. This document is the first attempt at writing the requirements for those verifications

[Verification Partners](https://github.com/BlockAuth/Planning/blob/master/Verification%20Partners.md)
Describes the roles of Verification Partners. Identity Registrars can also be Verification Partners if they let other Identity Registrars submit information to be verified on behalf of another Identity Registrar.
