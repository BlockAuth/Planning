##Founding Ideals and Goals

###Open Source Promise
We believe strongly that open source is critical to the long term best and most sustainable business model.

Our mission is to ensure that the countless hours of research and engineering that have gone into OpenID Connect continue to place the standard on the edge of security, innovation, and best practice.

All development will be open source.  This will keep innovation high and increase the amount of development and competition. 
Open source protects our hard work and your investment in our technology.  

###Working Together
We pledge to involve the community and working closely with developers, business owners, and end users. We gladly accept open discussion and even critism in public forums, such as [http://www.reddit.com/r/blockauth](the BlockAuth subreddit).

When there is a fundamental disagreement between the desires of developers, business owners, or end users, we will arbitrate tirelessly until the highest level of satisfaction has been achieved. 

###Open Book
All financial transactions will be public. We pledge to have a public ledger showing where money is being received and where it is being spent. 

###Decentralization
Everything possible will be decentralized or made democratic. Initially, BlockAuth will be built with several centralized systems, but the end goal is to have everything distributed and decentralized, with the business decisions themselves based on consensus. 

###Embracing the Community
We will do our best to help other relevant open source projects. When necessary, we will offer bounties for work or donate money to existing project maintainers. When we're approached by any other projects, we will embrace their interest, requests, and suggestions with an open mind. 

###Building a larger ecosystem
When possible, we will assist websites use BlockAuth identification technology at no charge. We will also help train developers, foster small startups that use the system, and help market anyone that does implement the authentication platform.
