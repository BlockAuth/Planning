##User supplied information we'll accept 

We want to be able to take any kind of information that users want to be able to provide and verify it through a mixture of automated and manual processes. Verification partners will be encouraged to come up with optimal verification procedures to reduce operating costs. The lower their costs, while still retaining quality, will cause other Identity Registrars to outsource that specific verification task to the verification partner.
