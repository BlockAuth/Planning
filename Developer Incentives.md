##Developer Incentives

This document needs more content and to be expanded. 

Basic summary:

When necessary, we will hire freelancers to do work, but we would rather pay develoeprs with a history of contributing to  open source projects out of their good nature. 

There isn't a formula for how much compensation will be supplied yet. 

We will find a place to post bounties if we can't find the right developer ourselves for each project or component

If we can't find a good place to post bounties that is close to free, we'll make one and make it another free BlockAuth required site to get even more people into the ecosystem and to benefit the entire open source and cryptocurrency community. 
We'll use GitTip (maybe. We need to check their fees. Are they taking advantage?)

Seriously, all these sites that use Bitcoin don't have any costs other than hosting, and those costs can be covered by taking a small protion of the transactions at the beginning of the month and then STOPPING once the months fees are paid. Or they can be supported by proper advertising.
