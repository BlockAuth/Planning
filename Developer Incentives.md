##Developer Incentives

###Existing Open Source Projects###
The technology that powers the Authentication system of BlockAuth registrars is mostly off-the-shelf open source code that just needs some extensions that are entirely allowed within the standards. OpenID Connect 1.0 is a new standard that was composed by some of the largest industry players over half a decade and is based on the established SAML, OpenID, and OAUTH2 standards. 

Because of the ubiquity of the core technology, it's easy to find existing projects with active development that we can approach. When we approach a existing developer of an open source program, we'll first establish how popular it is already in the community or how popular it can be with some more maturity and marketing. 

For developers who are willing to add in the BlockAuth extensions, we'll determine the going rate for their kind of work with their experience using ODesk or Freelancer and offer that amount. If the developer agrees to continue maintenance and development of the project beyond the initial integration, we'll offer occasional bonuses. 

###Abandoned or Low Activity Projects###
If we identity a project that has a good opportunity to be important, but it's been abandoned or is rarely updated, we'll attempt to contact the original developer to offer them maintenance and development funding at a lower rate than the primary open source projects. 

If a primary developer cannot be found, we'll make a post in relevent forums to attempt to find a person who is willing to fork the project and take ownership of future development in exchange for development funding. 

If we cannot find a primary developer, we'll fork it ourselves and find freelancers who can be paid to work on it occasionally. 

###Extra Incentives###
We'll attempt to determine the popularity of various projects in order to issue bonuses to developers or to provide funds to the project to get additional developers involved. 

If we can't find the right people, we'll issue general bounties to the community. 

If we can't find a good place to post bounties that is close to free, we'll make one and make it another free BlockAuth required site to get even more people into the ecosystem and to benefit the entire open source and cryptocurrency community. 

Projects that are doing important work in the same fields, even if it isn't specifically related to BlockAUth functions or integration, will still be eligible for no-strings-attached grants.
