## Token Generation
BlockAuth will generate a total of 20,996,011 Tokens on the Mastercoin Protocol. 

* 2 million will be available to Angel Investors in a 14-day and a 7-day round. 
* 1 million will be available to developers in a 14-day round
* 3 million will be available to the public in 4 7-day rounds during the public crowdsale 

## Crowdsale Pricing
* Round 1 - July 14th to Jul 27th - 1 million tokens for a whitelist of Angel Investors at 0.00025 BTC each to raise 250 BTC
* Round 2 - July 28th to Aug 3rd - 1 million tokens for accredited investors at 0.0005 BTC each to raise 500 BTC
* Round 3 - Aug 4th to Aug 17th - 1 million tokens for developers at 0.0005 BTC each to raise 500 BTC
* Round 4 - Aug 18th to Aug 24th - 1 million tokens for the general public at 0.00075 BTC each to raise 750 BTC

* Round 6 - Sep 1st to Sep 7th - 1 million tokens for the general public at 0.0015 BTC each to raise 1500 BTC

Any unsold tokens in each round will be distributed equitable among the participants of that round. For instance, if 100,000 tokens are sold in a round, the remaining 900,000 tokens will be distributed to participants proportionally to the quantity they purchased. 

In the event that all tokens are sold during the crowdsale, a total of 4500 BTC will be raised. 

## Crowdsale participation
The crowdsale is open to users worldwide who are able to send Bitcoin. 

In order to participate in the crowdsale, users will create an account on the beta Registrar.io service, a reference copy of what the upcoming franchised BlockAuth Identity Providers will be able to provide. 

Upon logging into the BlockAuth crowdsale system, buyers will be given an individual Bitcoin deposit address
to fund their account. 

Bitcoin transactions are applied immediately, but invalid Bitcoin transactions will result in the canceling of the order and the release of the tokens back into the pool of available tokens.

At the conclusion of the crowdsale, users will be able to log into the BlockAuth website to view their 
balances, submit buy and sell orders on the BlockAuth Token Exchange, or withdraw their tokens to a Mastercoin
wallet of their choice. 

##Disclosures
It's important to make some disclosures in order to avoid confusion on the part of new users of these technologies or those that might be unfarmilar with crowdsales and what they are buying.

*Friendly Information*

The views expressed in these statements and websites (while intended as neutral and informational), should be taken as friendly to the project and its success given it was prepared by those close to the projects development.

*This Is Not Stock or Equity*

Participation in the crowdsale will not provide you with a "security" or "equity" stake in this project. The digital token known as a "BlockAuth Token" is only useful when it is operating within the BlockAuth ecosystem after its development is complete.

*No Refunds*

No refunds will be made to purchasers of BlockAuth Tokens, should they change their mind at a later time, as the creation of the BlockAuth Tokens is locked in. Of course, once the purchaser receives his or her tokens after the crowdsale, they are free to send or sell them to anyone of their choice.

*Low Liquidity / Ability to Sell These Digital Tokens Will Be Limited*

If you are purchasing BlockAuth in order to hold it as "a store of wealth or value," please understand that this project is in its early days of development and that the market for these tokens might be very shallow. This will make it harder to buy and sell these tokens without effecting the price on the market.

##Use of the Bitcoins from the Crowdsale Event
BlockAuth is commiting to publishing a ledger of all uses of funds that are received from the Crowdsale event and from future revenue streams. 

The primary use of raised funds will be to engage core developers to work full-time to build out the BlockAuth infrastructure.

Funds will also be used to secure a relationship with legal advisors to help draft up the franchise agreements and to advise us on various regulations involving identity and privacy world-wide. With this information, we'll be able to provide a better product through the franchised Identity Registrars for member websites. 

Some funds will also be used to hire non-technical staff to interact with potential member websites, offer support, and perform verification services for the example identity registrar, Registrar.io. Those funds will also be used to pay for various components of automated verification tasks, such as subscriptions to various databases. 

Money raised during the Crowdsale will also be used to buy crypto currency in the protocols that the BlockAuth ecosystem relies on. For example, a portion of the Bitcoins collected during crowdsale will be used to puchase Mastercoin, APICoins, SAFE, and any other digital token that it functions on top of in order for the BlockAuth system to hold a stake in the platforms it is built on top of. Holding a mix of BTC, Mastercoin, APICoins, and Maidsafe Coins provides the BlockAuth ecosystem with a longterm stake in the future of these protocols.

Lastly, bounties and challenges will be issued to the general community to increase the number of modules, plugins, and code examples to make it easier for member websites to integrate the metadata that BlockAuth Identity Registrars can provide. Those same bounties and challenges will also occasionally be used to pay for security and code audits as well as commissioning open source verification modules for the franchise packages.
