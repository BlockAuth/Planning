BlockAuth will generate a total of 20,996,011 Tokens on the Mastercoin Protocol. 

5 million of those will be available during the crowdsale. 

The first million tokens will be offered for 0.0005 BTC and will generate up to 500 BTC
The next two million tokens will be offered for 0.0001 BTC and will generate up to 2000 BTC
The last two million tokens will be offered for 0.0002 BTC and will generate up to 4000 BTC

In the event that all tokens are sold during the crowdsale, a total of 6500 BTC will be raised. 

If all of the tokens are not sold, buyers will be proportionally issued the remaining tokens as
a bonus so the end result of the crowdsale is that all 5 million tokens will be distributed. 

In order to participate in the crowdsale, users will create an account on the beta Registrar.io service
Upon logging into the BlockAuth crowdsale system, they will be given an individual Bitcoin deposit address
that funds their account. 

Transactions are applied immediately, but invalid Bitcoin transactions will result in the canceling of the order and the
release of the tokens back into the purchase pool.

At the conclusion of the crowdsale, users will be able to log into the BlockAuth website to view their 
balances, submit buy and sell orders on the BlockAuth Token Exchange, or withdraw their tokens to a Mastercoin
wallet of their choice.
